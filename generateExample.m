%% Generate case study:
% This script generates a random, compact polyhedron in \R^n, with k
% facets, and a linear control system in Brunovsky normal form.
%
% Three required variables in workspace (A, B, m):
% Matrices A,B : LTI system in terms of matrices (A,B).
% m = number of facets for the polyhedron to be generated.
%
% This script makes use of the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3.0:
% M. Herceg, M. Kvasnica, C. Jones, and M. Morari, 
% ``Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3.0,'' in Proc. of the European Control 
% Conference, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, July 17-19 2013, pp. 502-510,

%% Generate random bounded Polyhedron - with k constraints:

% Needs dimension size 'n', and number of constraints 'k' in workspace.

disp('Generating polyhedron..')
D = Polyhedron('H',[0 1 1]);
while (~D.isBounded && ~D.isEmptySet)
    G = -1 + (1+1)*rand(k,n);
    F = rand(k,1);
    D = Polyhedron('H',[G F]);
end
% Make all elements rational numbers with 10-decimal-digit precision.
G = G.*1e10;
G = round(G);
G = G./1e10;
F = F.*1e10;
F = round(F);
F = F./1e10;
D = Polyhedron('H',[G F]);
disp('..done!')

%% and a system in Brunovsky normal form:

disp('System in Brunovsky normal form..')
Ac = [zeros(n-1,1) eye(n-1); zeros(1,n)];
Bc = [zeros(n-1,1); 1];

disp('..done!')
