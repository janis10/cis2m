# Controlled Invariant Sets in 2 Moves (cis2m)

This repository is dedicated to the computation of Controlled Invariant Sets (CISs) of Polyhedral Safe Sets for the class of Controllable Discrete-time Time-invariant Linear Systems. 

The proposed algorithm is based on an idea that works in two moves:
1. The problem is lifted in a higher dimensional space, where the Maximal Controlled Invariant Set (MCIS) is computed exactly and in closed-form.
2. The above MCIS is projected back to the original space, where it constitutes a CIS for the original problem.

Moreover, a hierarchy of CISs is established, which is parameterized by a positive integer denoting the level of the hierarchy. Typically higher levels of the hierarchy correspond to larger CISs (see Section 4.6 [AT20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3365365.3382205) for more information).

### Dependencies:
The current version of the repository makes use of the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3.0 to handle projections of polytopes:

### Quick-start:
The main wrapper function for this code is `computeCIS(A,B,Gx,Fx,L,Gu,Fu,E,Gw,Fw,method,verbose)`:
  * `A`, `B`, and `E` are matrices that define the discrete-time linear system `x^+ = Ax + Bu + Ew`.
  * `Gx` is a matrix, and `Fx` is a vector that define the polyhedral safe set `Sx = {x \in \R^n | Gx x <= Fx}`.
  * `L` is a positive integer denoting the level of the hierarchy. Typically larger values of `L` correspond to larger CISs (see Section 4.6 [AT20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3365365.3382205) for more information).
  * `Gu` and `Fu` similarly define polyhedral input constraints `Su = {u \in \R^m | Gu u <= Fu}`. For unconstrained input use `Gu = []`, `Fu = []`.
  * `Gw` and `Fw` similarly define the disturbance set `Sw = {w \in \R^k | Gw w <= Fw}`. In absense of disturbance use `E = []`, `Gw = []`, `Fw = []`.
  * `method`: if not specified the default (best for most scenarios) algorithm will be selected (recommended). Legacy options for reference to specific paper results are: `CDC19`, `HSCC20`, `ACC21a`, `ACC21b`.
  * `verbose` is `0` for silent output, or `1`for verbose. Default is `0`.

The function will return a CIS of `Sx` in the form of a tuple `(cisA, cisb)` such that `CIS = {x \in \R^n | cisA x <= cisb}`.
