## Computing Controlled Invariant Sets in Two Moves

This tool computes a Controlled Invariant Set for Discrete-time Linear Systems. It is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in:

Tzanis Anevlavis and Paulo Tabuada, 
"Computing controlled invariant sets in two moves", 
In 2019 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). [Preprint](http://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/tzanis/home/anevlavisCDC2019.pdf).

In the `paper-examples` folder you can find the files that replicate the two examples of the above paper. 

For any comments contact Tzanis Anevlavis @ janis10@ucla.edu.

See also: [github repository](http://github.com/janis10/cis2m-hierarchy) for a _Hieararchy_ on computing larger controlled invariant sets for Discrete-time Linear Systems.
